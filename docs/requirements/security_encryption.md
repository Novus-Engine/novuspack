# Security and Encryption Requirements

## Encryption Algorithms

- REQ-CRYPTO-001: Supported ciphers and key sizes are enforced for file encryption [type: constraint]. [security.md#32-encryption-algorithms](../tech_specs/security.md#32-encryption-algorithms)

## Quantum-Safe Encryption

- REQ-CRYPTO-002: Quantum-safe signature and key management options are available. [security.md#31-quantum-safe-encryption](../tech_specs/security.md#31-quantum-safe-encryption)
- REQ-CRYPTO-003: Quantum-safe keys are generated correctly with appropriate security levels. [security.md#341-ml-kem-key-management](../tech_specs/security.md#341-ml-kem-key-management)
