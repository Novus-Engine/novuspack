Feature: Generic Concurrency Patterns

# This file previously contained placeholder scenarios for generic concurrency patterns.
# All requirements in this file are documentation-only pattern definitions that don't require test coverage.
#
# Pattern definitions document design patterns but are not testable requirements.
# Actual generic concurrency behavior is tested in dedicated behavior feature files.
#
# This file is kept for reference but contains no test scenarios.
