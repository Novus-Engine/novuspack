Feature: File Type System Definitions

# This file previously contained placeholder scenarios for file type system definitions.
# All requirements in this file are documentation-only system definitions that don't require test coverage.
#
# System architecture definitions document organization but are not testable requirements.
# Actual file type detection and behavior is tested in dedicated behavior feature files.
#
# This file is kept for reference but contains no test scenarios.
