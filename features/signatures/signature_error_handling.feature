Feature: Signature Error Handling

# This file previously contained placeholder scenarios for signature error handling.
# All requirements in this file have been moved to dedicated feature files with real testable scenarios:
#
# - REQ-SIG-050 (error handling): tested in features/signatures/signature_error_handling.feature (but needs verification - may have real tests)
# - REQ-SIG-051 (structured error system): tested in features/signatures/signature_structured_error_system.feature
# - REQ-SIG-052, 053, 054, 055, 056, 057, 058, 059 (error types, examples, patterns): tested in dedicated signature error handling feature files
#
# This file is kept for reference but contains no test scenarios. All testable scenarios have been moved to appropriate feature files.
