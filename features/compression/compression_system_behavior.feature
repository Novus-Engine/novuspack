# - REQ-COMPR-114 (DecompressPackage behavior): tested in features/compression/decompresspackage_purpose_and_usage.feature
# - REQ-COMPR-120 (CompressPackageStream behavior): tested in features/compression/compresspackagestream_purpose_and_usage_compression_streaming.feature
# - REQ-COMPR-125 (DecompressPackageStream behavior): tested in dedicated decompression streaming feature files
# - REQ-COMPR-129 (CompressPackageFile behavior): tested in features/compression/compresspackagefile_operation_behavior.feature
# - REQ-COMPR-134 (DecompressPackageFile behavior): tested in features/compression/decompresspackagefile_operation_behavior.feature
