Feature: Performance considerations

  @REQ-COMPR-081 @happy
  Scenario: Performance considerations define optimization guidelines
    Given compression operations
    When performance optimization is needed
    Then performance considerations provide optimization guidelines
    And guidelines cover memory, CPU, and I/O aspects
    And optimization strategies are defined

  @REQ-COMPR-081 @happy
  Scenario: Performance considerations balance compression ratio vs speed
    Given compression operations
    When compression type is selected
    Then trade-offs between compression ratio and speed are considered
    And use case determines optimal balance
    And performance matches requirements

  @REQ-COMPR-081 @happy
  Scenario: Performance considerations account for package size and content type
    Given compression operations
    When compression is performed
    Then package size impacts performance considerations
    And content type affects compression efficiency
    And appropriate compression strategy is selected

  @REQ-COMPR-081 @happy
  Scenario: Performance considerations optimize for different use cases
    Given compression operations for various use cases
    When compression is configured
    Then performance is optimized for specific use case
    And archival storage optimizes for space
    And real-time applications optimize for speed
