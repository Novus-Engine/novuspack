Feature: Compression Configuration Patterns

  @REQ-COMPR-147 @happy
  Scenario: Configuration patterns provide common compression setups
    Given compression operations with different requirements
    When configuration patterns are used
    Then common compression setups are available
    And patterns match typical use cases
    And configuration is simplified

  @REQ-COMPR-147 @happy
  Scenario: Configuration patterns optimize for different scenarios
    Given compression operations for various scenarios
    When appropriate configuration pattern is selected
    Then configuration optimizes for that scenario
    And performance matches requirements
    And resource usage is appropriate

  @REQ-COMPR-147 @happy
  Scenario: Configuration patterns follow best practices
    Given compression configuration needs
    When configuration patterns are applied
    Then configurations follow industry best practices
    And patterns align with modern compression systems
    And configurations are optimized

  @REQ-COMPR-147 @happy
  Scenario: Configuration patterns simplify compression setup
    Given compression operations requiring configuration
    When configuration patterns are used
    Then setup complexity is reduced
    And configuration is more straightforward
    And common settings are pre-configured
