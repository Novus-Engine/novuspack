Feature: Future concurrency considerations

  @REQ-API_BASIC-213 @happy
  Scenario: Future considerations describe planned concurrency improvements
    Given current concurrency limitations
    When future improvements are considered
    Then future considerations describe planned concurrency enhancements
    And improvements target safer or more performant concurrent usage
    And plans preserve backward compatible semantics where applicable
    And future work is consistent with API organization and state management
    And considerations inform long-term design decisions
