Feature: Supported operations

# This file previously contained scenarios that duplicated tests in compression domain feature files.
# All testable scenarios for signing compressed packages are covered in:
# - features/compression/signing_compressed_packages.feature (REQ-COMPR-023, REQ-COMPR-025)
# - features/writing/signing_compressed_packages_signing_signing.feature (REQ-WRITE-041) - writing-specific scenarios
# - features/core/signing_and_compression_relationship_signing_operation.feature (REQ-CORE-034) - relationship tests
#
# REQ-CORE-035 is a general requirement about supported operations. Specific operation tests belong in domain-specific files.
# This file is kept for reference but contains no test scenarios.
