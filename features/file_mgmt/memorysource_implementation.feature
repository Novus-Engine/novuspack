Feature: MemorySource Implementation

  @REQ-FILEMGMT-065 @happy
  Scenario: Memorysource provides in-memory data source
    Given byte data in memory
    When NewMemorySource is called with the data
    Then MemorySource is created
    And FileSource interface is implemented
    And in-memory data source is provided

  @REQ-FILEMGMT-065 @happy
  Scenario: MemorySource reads from in-memory byte data
    Given a MemorySource created from byte data
    When file content is read
    Then content is read from in-memory byte data
    And data access is direct
    And no filesystem overhead occurs

  @REQ-FILEMGMT-065 @happy
  Scenario: MemorySource is suitable for small files
    Given a MemorySource created from small file data
    When small file is processed
    Then processing is efficient
    And memory usage is appropriate
    And performance is optimized for small files

  @REQ-FILEMGMT-065 @happy
  Scenario: MemorySource is suitable for generated content
    Given a MemorySource created from generated byte data
    When generated content is processed
    Then content is accessed directly from memory
    And no filesystem operations occur
    And processing is efficient

  @REQ-FILEMGMT-065 @happy
  Scenario: MemorySource has no filesystem overhead
    Given a MemorySource created from byte data
    When file operations are performed
    Then no filesystem operations occur
    And no filesystem overhead is incurred
    And performance benefits from direct memory access

  @REQ-FILEMGMT-065 @error
  Scenario: MemorySource handles empty data gracefully
    Given empty byte data
    When NewMemorySource is called
    Then MemorySource is created successfully
    And empty data is handled gracefully
    And no error occurs
