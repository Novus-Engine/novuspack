Feature: Security Structures

# This file previously contained placeholder scenarios for security structures.
# All requirements in this file are documentation-only structure definitions that don't require test coverage.
#
# Structure definitions document data formats but are not testable requirements.
# Actual security validation behavior is tested in dedicated behavior feature files.
#
# This file is kept for reference but contains no test scenarios.
