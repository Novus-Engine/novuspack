Feature: Package Information Metadata

# This file previously contained placeholder scenarios for package information metadata.
# All requirements in this file are documentation-only usage examples that don't require test coverage.
#
# Usage examples demonstrate patterns and best practices but are not testable requirements.
# Actual package information behavior is tested in dedicated behavior feature files.
#
# This file is kept for reference but contains no test scenarios.
