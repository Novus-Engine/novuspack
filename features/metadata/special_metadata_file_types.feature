Feature: Special Metadata File Types

# This file previously contained placeholder scenarios for special metadata file types.
# All requirements in this file are documentation-only definitions that don't require test coverage.
#
# Special file type definitions document classifications but are not testable requirements.
# Actual special file behavior is tested in dedicated behavior feature files.
#
# This file is kept for reference but contains no test scenarios.
